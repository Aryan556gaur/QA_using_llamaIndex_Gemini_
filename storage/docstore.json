The most\r\nimportant presupposition of morality on which the entire Indian ethical thought is based is called the law of\r\nKarma. The idea of the Gita is not negation of action, but performance of action with detached mind. This\r\nsection is divided into three parts: Part I \u2013 Meaning of Karma, Part II \u2013 Classification of Karma, and Part III \u2013\r\nTheory of Karma.\r\nPART I\r\nMeaning of Karma: Now the question is what is exactly meant by the word \u2018Karma\u2019? It is not easy to\r\nanswer to the question because we find that there is no agreement among the scholars on this issue. This is\r\nsimply because the word karma has been used to mean different senses in different contexts. There is no\r\nparticular meaning of it. So it may be stated that in order to realize the meaning of the word \u2018karma\u2019 we must go\r\nthrough its different uses found in the explanation of different schools of philosophy (Pal, 2004). The word\r\nkarma is derived from the Sanskrit root \u2018kr\u2019 etymologically and this word means \u2018to do\u2019 and therefore karma\r\nmeans by derivation an action, a work, a deed, etc (ibid).\r\nExplanation of karma in the Srimad Bhagavad-Gita is bhutabhavodbhavakora visargha karmasamjnitha\r\n(The Gita 8.3), i.e., the sacrifice which release the creative forces of the universe is known as karma. In this\r\nverse the meaning of the word \u2018visargah\u2019 is \u2018visaryan\u2019, i.e., immersed and different substances as ghee, cake;\r\nfruits etc. are given up without desire of fruits for the sake of god. Thus the commentators take decision to give\r\nup the substances as ghee, cake; fruits etc. to the God without desire are a main cause of attaining liberation. So\r\nif one performs sacrifices maintaining Vedic commands gets heavenly pleasure (Tiwary, K. (1998). Keeps on\r\ntransmigrating from one life to another along with the soul till liberation is attained.\r\nThe concept of karma is also used to signify two different meanings as casual and ethical sense. The\r\ncasual sense, the use of karma is descriptive in character because it describes the casual character of actphenomena and its asserts that every action has natural, casual result and the effect of karma is never destroyed\r\ntill it is realize by doer of karma and before its realization it exists in the form of samaskara which cannot be\r\nperceived by our sense organs. While the non-theistic karmavadins think that samskara resides in soul and when\r\nit is ripened it automatically starts ginving result mechanically without the role of any divine agency (Pal, J.\r\n(2004).\r\nAccording to Swami Vivekananda, the word karma has come from the root \u2018kr\u2019 and the meaning of\r\nroot\u2019kr\u2019 is to do \u2018 so all action are karmas\u2019 (Vivekananda, S. (2001). Etymologically the word karma means the\r\neffect of actions.

Karma is the manifestation of will (ibid).\r\nPART II\r\nClassification of Karma: Karma literally means action of any kind done by human being. But actions which\r\nare morally significant are known as voluntary actions.\r\nKarma amy be classified into various ways according to the Indian thinkers\r\n1. Voluntary Action or Aichhika Karma : voluntary action is an action performed knowingly and\r\nwillingly by self conscious and self determining person with desire, pre-vision and free choice of means and\r\nends voluntary action is done by a spring of action and this action is also done by feeling of want.\r\nThe bodily actions produce changes in the external world and these changes are called consequences (Sannyal,\r\nJ. 2006).\r\nNon-voluntary Action or Anaichhika Karma : non-voluntary actions are those actions which are devoid of\r\nmoral quality and cannot be judged as right or wrong. Non-voluntary action is also considered as reflex actions\r\nor automatic actions which responses to sensory stimulation and these actions are not controlled by\r\nconsciousness. By repetition non-voluntary actions are fixed as habits and become automatic (Ibid., pp.26-30).\r\nA Study on Karmayoga in Bhagavad Gita\r\n*Corresponding Author: Gobinda Bhattacharjee 12 | Page\r\nEvery karma or voluntary action is divided into three classes as (a) Sancita karma or reserved stock (b)\r\nPrarabdha karma or fruit bearing action and (c) Kriyamana karma or current action.\r\nSancita Karma (Reserve Stock): Every action performed in the form of a potentially (ardsta0 which results\r\npleasurable or painful experience to the doer in a subsequent birth or in the present birth. Sancita karma or\r\naccumulated potentially is responsible for the good and evil impulse of our mind (Godyandka 2007).\r\nKriyamana Karma (Current Action): A karma which is being performed with some interested motive as well\r\nas with attachment, sense of doership and which is being gathered in this life is called kriyaman karma.\r\nPrarabdha Karma (Fruit Bearing Action): Huge stock of accumulated action, consisting of virtous as well as\r\nsinful deeds, an action is taken out to serve one life time and this action which has begun to bear fruit and which\r\nwill be exhausted only on their fruit being enjoyed and not otherwise, is known as prarabdha karma.\r\nAccording to Indian thinkers, further division of action is sakama karma, i.e. attached or desirous action and\r\nniskama karma, i.e. non-attached or selfless action.\r\nSakama Karma: Sakama karma, i.e. attached action is that action when one does not realize that real essence\r\nof the object of the world and which is performed with some desires. So actions which come under the influence\r\nof the law of karma are those which are performed with the conscious desire of achieving of worldly pleasure\r\nare known as attached action.\r\nNiskama Karma: niskama karma, i.e. disinterested actions are those actions which are performed without any\r\nconscious intention, i.e. completely devoid of desire.", "start_char_idx": 2927, "end_char_idx": 6272, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89e41f55-41ce-4152-b248-11050885c9a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "89e41f55-41ce-4152-b248-11050885c9a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "227de336-529a-429f-bc76-94a2df494f65", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "29995c0202e013ba815c1f24565e00dc2793bc369a407136a602eddfb4a7b686", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "96a5afed-4035-488c-9677-10c9ec52c23d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "45cfb385f3570084561e573b445bfccf09aa67825a1678835d31e7dd98fbb127", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "511d9c43-66a5-4205-9d6e-5cbb1fba2c45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0f2145845cc60818639e00d9459889114e956d2c4fc0912f309030b34f6f8af9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "completely devoid of desire.\r\nThe ideal of niskama karma may be taken as a synthesis between pravrtti and nivrtti in Indian ethical system.\r\nPravrtti is the path of active life with the object of attaining heaven. On the other hand, nivrtti is the path of total\r\nrenunciation of works.\r\nThe Gita says in this regard in the following way:\r\nKarmanyevadhikaraste ma phalesu kadacana !\r\nMa karmaphalaheturbhurma te sangostvakarmani!!( The Bhagavadagita, 2.47)\r\nThus niskama karma is neither naiskarma (inaction0 nor karma (action) with an eye upon the fruit thereof. Thus\r\naccording to the Bhagavadgita, The ideal of niskama karma is realized by performing selfless action, surrender\r\nthe fruits of actions to God.\r\nPART III\r\nThe Theory of Karma: The law of karma is considered to be one of the most fundamental features of\r\nIndian philosophy. The theory of karma is a general theory of moral conduct that has been built with the ethical\r\nworld view. The law of karma is mainly related to human conduct in the normal sense of the term. So action\r\nmeans intentional action and this will be its meaning in the analysis of the law of karma. The domain of the\r\noperation of te law of karma is said that to be the entire universe which means that it is applied to both human\r\nand non-human beings (Tiwary, K. (1998). Classical Indian Ethical Thought).\r\nThe law of karma is said to be based on the law of causation to the sphere of human conduct. The law\r\nof causation means every event of the world is determined by its cause. So everything that happens in the moral\r\nworld is regulated beforehand. The law of karma is said to be an extension of the law of causation to the world\r\nof action because it claims that every action has some effects, i.e. actions are as good cause as non-actions. The\r\nlaw acquires its distinctive significance by being an extension in the moral direction.\r\nAccording to Hiriyana, the doctrine of karma signifies not merely that the events of life are determined\r\nby their causes, but also that there is absolute justice in the rewards and punishment that fail to our fate. The\r\nrewards and punishments which fail to our fate are the consequences of our actions (Rajendra Prasad, Karma,\r\nCausation and Retributive Morality Indian Council of Pholosophical Research, 1989, pp.21)\r\nThe law of karma has been emphasized by all the interpreters of Indian philosophy. For\r\nRadhakrishnan, according to the law of karma there is nothing uncertain in the moral world, \u2018we reap what we\r\nsow\u2019. The attempts to overleap the law of karma is as fruitless as the attempt to leap over one\u2019s shadow\r\n(Rajendra Prasad, Karma, Causation and Retributive Morality Indian Council of Pholosophical Research,\r\n1989, pp.210-213)\r\nAction produces result indirectly . The process is as soon as an action, right or wrong, is performed, a\r\nsubtle result of karma, merit or demerit, is produced.

Thus the rational mind of man find itself in a position in which it can neither given up\r\nthe belief in the law of karma nor can accept it in any definite form.\r\nSECTION II\r\nKarma-Yoga in Bhagavad-Gita\r\nIt is necessary to properly realize the meaning of the word \u2018Karma yoga,\u2019 we should define some\r\nimportant words and otherwise many difficulties subsequently may arise. Which is also describe in the second\r\nchapter for this reason, we should first examine and explain the meaning of the word \u2018Karma\u2019 and \u2018Yoga\u2019. This\r\nsection is divided into three parts \u2013 Karma and Yoga, Niskama Karma; and Lokasamgraha.\r\nPart I\r\nKarma and Yoga: The word \u2018Karma\u2019 comes from the root \u2018Kr\u2019 which means \u2018doing\u2019, \u2018affairs\u2019, or\r\n\u2018activity\u2019 and that same ordinary meaning is intended in the Bhagavad-Gita. It prescribes some action for\r\nrealizing Isvara in each and every religion. According to the ancient Vedic religion, this action is sacrificial\r\nritual (Tilak, SrimadBhagavadgitaRahasya or karmayogasastra, pp. 71-72).\r\nThe word \u2018yoga\u2019 comes from the root \u2018yuj\u2019 which means \u2018to join \u2018 and its root meaning is \u2018the state of\r\nunion \u2018, \u2018combination\u2019, \u2018addition\u2019 or \u2018co-existence\u2019, or \u2018staying together\u2019 and later on it has also come to mean\r\nthe \u2018means\u2019, \u2018device\u2019, \u2018method\u2019 or \u2018thing to be done\u2019 etc.\r\nIn the Gita, the word \u2018yoga\u2019, yogi or other compounds from the word \u2018yoga\u2019 have occurred so many\r\ntimes. We find almost everywhere the word used more or less in the meaning of \u2018means\u2019, \u2018skilful device\u2019,\r\n\u2018method\u2019, \u2018the thing to be done\u2019, \u2018union\u2019 etc. And it must be said that this is one of the comprehensive words\r\nused in the Gita.

But in the\r\nBhagavad-Gita the concept of karma has been used without any ambiguity in the sense of action and action is\r\nthat what is done. The word \u2018niskama' is also a composite concept because it is made up of two different\r\nconcepts as \u2018nihi' and \u2018kama'. The word \u2018kama' means desire or \u2018kama' is highly a vague concept because this\r\nword has been used in different senses in different contexts. But in the Bhagavad-Gita, it is generally used in the\r\nsense of sensuous desires. So when niskama karma translated in terms of desireless action, it should be taken\r\nmean an action done by the doer in desireless spirit.\r\nIn the Gita, it has been stated that to live for a moment in the world is to do some sorts of krama. It is\r\nnot possible for one to abandon action, i.e., if one has to live in the world, in the land of action, can one escape\r\nfrom action? We see ourselves that thirst, hunger and other desires do not leave us so long as our body lives. If\r\nthe path of renunciation gives us the liberty of performing a disgraceful action like begging for satisfying\r\ndesires, then according to sastrasthere is no inconvenience to perform all worldly actions with a desirelessframe\r\nof mind. According to the Gita, all abandonment of actions made when the mental control is not perfect and all\r\nabandonment of actions is the result of ignorance.\r\nIt has been stated in the Gita that the saints who have known the identity of Brahman and the atman\r\nperforms all activities in the illusory world merely by their body or merely by their organs and it has also being\r\nstated that the real abandonment of actions consists in performing actions with unattached mind without\r\nentertaining the hope of reward merely as a duty and non-performance of action is not a real abandonment of\r\naction. So there is no problem of performing actions through the bodily organs with disinterested mind.\r\nSome persons raise a further objection that when the mind has become desirless as a result of the\r\nacquisition of knowledge and all desires have been destroyed. There remains nothing which moreover, in\r\nsupport of this argument, it has been stated in the Uttara Gita:\r\nJnanamrtenatraptasyakrtakrtyasyayoginah |\r\nNa castikinchitkartavyamasticennasatattvavit|| (Uttaragita,1.23)\r\nA Study on Karmayoga in Bhagavad Gita\r\n*Corresponding Author: Gobinda Bhattacharjee 14 | Page\r\nThat is, a man who has become jnani (krtakrtya) as a result having drunk the rector of knowledge, no\r\nfurther duty remains and if further duty remains that man is not a real jnani or tattvajnani.", "start_char_idx": 12303, "end_char_idx": 15326, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e10e22a4-bc2d-42a2-a68c-453370fc0105": {"__data__": {"id_": "e10e22a4-bc2d-42a2-a68c-453370fc0105", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "227de336-529a-429f-bc76-94a2df494f65", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "29995c0202e013ba815c1f24565e00dc2793bc369a407136a602eddfb4a7b686", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1ed6057-efb4-4041-a476-2a127f4f7be3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "91188cd0c59af3d824f8f345b5ec9819da46531897f594165afc76454ad1491e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7c869952-c9c0-4d8e-a7d3-9eb8e67ed29c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fad4df2549acdbc4b41c31a3ea657a9b49596349f58d5056866f2fb41ead4c07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So someone thinks\r\nthat the Bhagavad-Gita accepts this position that karma leaves a man of its own accord after the acquisition of\r\nknowledge.\r\nThe root cause of our suffering is attachment which is a part of desire not merely a wish. According to\r\nthe Gita, instead of killing desires of all kinds, one should only give up the attachment to the object of desire\r\nand go on performing all actions. Though one May be free from desires of all kinds, it is not possible that\r\nactivity comes to an end. We see that whether there is desire or not, constant actions like breathing etc. Go on.\r\nEven for a single moment is an action by itself. So it is not possible for us to become free from karma after\r\nacquisition of perfect knowledge as well as the destruction of desire of all kinds. And that why it has been stated\r\nin the Gita: \u2018na hi kascitksanamapijatutisthatyakarmakrt\u2019(ibid. 3.5), no one can remain alive without performing\r\naction.\r\nIn the third chapter of the Gita (3/17-19), the Gita has said that there is no duty for the jnani after the\r\nacquisition of knowledge of his own. Someone says that the two propositions as the jnani is free from duty and\r\nthe jnani does not escape from karma are mutually contradictory. So as the jnani has more duty for himself, it is\r\nnow necessary for him to perform all his duties without desire.\r\nIt is true that the hope for fruit may thus be destroyed by means of knowledge. So it is true that the\r\njnani should, after acquisition of knowledge, perform those very actions which are performed by the ignorant\r\nwith a hope for fruit but looking upon advantages or disadvantages, happiness or unhappiness as one and the\r\nsame with courage and one should perform it with pure reason Being indifferent in the matter of fruit according\r\nto his own authority and purely as a matter of duty.\r\nIf it is thus proved that the jnani must, so long as life lasts, desirelessly perform all duties which befall\r\nhim in the course of life, having given up the hope for result. And therefore the last and most important advice\r\nof the Lord of Arjuna in support of the doctrine of Karma yoga is that:\r\n\u2018lokasamgrahamevapisampasyankartumarhasi', (The Gita 3.20) i.e., one must perform action without\r\nattachment for the public benefit. It is true that the word \u2018lokasamgraha\u2019 ordinarily means the benefit of human\r\nbeings, and it also means that the man is superior to the other created beings in the world.\r\nHarmonisation of Action (karma) and Renunciation (Tyaga): According to the Gita, though the Karma\r\nyoga is superior to renunciation for attaining salvation, nowhere in the Gita has been shown any dishonour for\r\nthat path. The lord has clearly stated that both the path of renunciation and the path of action equally lead to\r\nsalvation, that is to say, they are both of the same value. And therefore the Lord has stated that \u2018ekamsamkyam\r\nca yogam ca yah pasyati.\u2019(The Gita, 5.5) The jnani (wise man) says that if any one path is properly followed,\r\nthe same result of both is achieved and where the follower of the samkhya path reach, the follower of the action\r\nreach the same goal.", "start_char_idx": 15327, "end_char_idx": 18444, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c869952-c9c0-4d8e-a7d3-9eb8e67ed29c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c869952-c9c0-4d8e-a7d3-9eb8e67ed29c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "227de336-529a-429f-bc76-94a2df494f65", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "29995c0202e013ba815c1f24565e00dc2793bc369a407136a602eddfb4a7b686", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e10e22a4-bc2d-42a2-a68c-453370fc0105", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}, "hash": "bf9852bec083417f95b63ca22389fc21bfd943fb7064798e534eab37093b9b9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "525f9a77-c9e5-41a7-b01b-66ffa307e554", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b03e8246b44c1c7710838eb166246b6a808f77c64854dbf50cae8330f93c145b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A person who realises that jnana and karma is the same thing may be said to have seen the\r\ntrue principle. Moreover in the Karma yoga, one has to renounce the hope for the fruit of action.\r\n\u2018nahyasamnyastasamkalpoyogi bhavatikascana,\u2019(Ibid., 6.2) i.e., unless one performs sannyasa i.e., tyaga of the\r\nsamkalpa of the hope of reward or fruit in the shape of desirous mind, he does not become a yogi (Karma yogi).\r\nIn this way the Lord has skilfully harmonised as far as possible between these two paths. But from the point of\r\nview of worldly affairs, the most superior mode of life is to keep renunciation in the mind itself and to go on\r\nperforming the lifelong action which is beneficial to the world through the medium of bodily organs because the\r\nLord has definitely said that both renunciation and action are found in the same place.\r\nKarmanabadhyatejanturvidyayatupramucyate|\r\nTasmatkarma nakurvantiyatayahparadarsinah ||\r\nThe proposition : \u2018karmanabadhyatejanturvidyayatupramucyate means karma neither binds nor\r\nreleases anybody; rather man is bound by karma as a result of his hope for fruits or by his own attachment. So it\r\nis not necessary to give up action because when this attachment is given up, one stands released and then he\r\nmay perform action by his extranal organs. In this way the Gita has harmonised between knowledge and action.\r\nIn the Vedic religion the two independent paths of karma sannyasa, i.e., renunciation and desire less\r\naction, i.e., yoga are equally good alternatives through the Karma yoga is superior to the path of renunciation.\r\nThus the synthesis between karma and jnana has been shown in the Gita.\r\nIt has been drawn that if the main object of the Gita is to harmonise knowledge with devotion to\r\nsupport the path of Karma yoga on that basis, then all this apparent inconsistencies disappear and one cannot\r\nbut admire the super human wisdom of the Gita in bringing about a fusion among knowledge, devotion and\r\nKarma yoga in most comprehensive way.

Kant teaches that higher spiritual truths are not intelligible in terms of the\r\nconcepts and categories of senses and understanding. He emphasises the purity of will and its freedom from any\r\nempirical content. For him, the good will is a jewel which shines by its own. The same idea is elaborately and\r\nwith frequency of emphasis defined and vindicated in the Bhagavad-Gita. Purity of motive is the basis of ethical\r\nconduct in both Kant and the Gita and Both of them emphasise with equal strength and force the need of the\r\ncontrol of the senses and the inclinations, the emotions and the passions constituting the lower self of man.\r\nThe Gita lays emphasis on regulating and controlling the senses and adjusting and directing them to\r\nhigher values and purposes in life. On the other hand, Kant also teaches that the man as a slave to the senses and\r\ninclinations cannot pursue the higher goal and purpose of life. For Kant, The doctrine of categorical imperative\r\nwhich teaches that duty has to be performed for the sake of duty. The Gita says that how the path of niskama\r\nkarma is only the path of discipline for achieving integrity, balance proportion and harmony in life.\r\nSECTION III\r\nKARMAYOGA IN CONTEMPORARY TIME\r\nThe basic message of this chapter is to show that the social applications of karma yoga of the Bhagavat\r\nGita can effectively lead to all round development and progress in the social, economic, political and cultural\r\nfield. Bhagavatgita has played an important role for guiding modern man in the performance of day-to- day\r\nduties. That involvement with the world is expressed by the term lokasamgraha. The term covers amplitude of\r\nsocial and spiritual forms of behavior and attitudes of mind.\r\nSome great thinkers, religious and political leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Aurobindo\r\nGhosh,Balgangadhar Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and so many great men have greatly influenced by the ideal of\r\nkarmayoga.

The purusottama is\r\nthe Lord in the ksara. He is in the heart of the every creature and is manifested in his countless bibhuties. The\r\nkshara , the personal, the purusa self \u2013subjected to prakrti, is only one aspect of the purusottama.

The spiritual nature is\r\ndesignated by srikrishna as paraprakriti, the purusottama, the supreme Being, the supreme soul, the\r\nTranscendent and universal spirit. The original and eternal nature of the spirit and its transcendent and\r\norigainating sakti is what is meant by the paraprakrti and the origin of the world is the active power of his\r\nnature and this is the womb of all beings, etadyontni bhutani (Gita 7.6).The lord is the birth of the whole world\r\nand so too its dissolution and there is nothing else beyond him.\r\nSri Aurobindo thinks over the para prakrti as the infinite, timeless consciousness power of self existent\r\nbeing. Out of which all the objects of the world are manisfested and come out of representing a synthesis of the\r\nvedantic concept of sat-chit- ananda. Harmonizing \u2018chit\u2019 or consciousness is reffered to as chit-sakti or\r\nconsciousness force.\r\nAccording to Sri Aurobindo, the main message of the Gita is founded upon the concepts of\r\npurusottama and paraprakrti and his new interpretation of the Gita is irrevocably linked with action performed\r\nfor purposes of lokasamgraha.

P. (1997). Gandhiji idea of\r\nnonviolent fight for independence of india from a foreign rule has closed links with the Gita doctrine of\r\nswadharma.\r\nGanghiji technique of waging non- violent fights for social and political causes take a concrete shape\r\nin South Africa during the years 1906-14 and his own spiritual, moral and mental preparation for making such a\r\nnew experiment.\r\nRole of Bhagavad Gita: Contribution of Gandhiji in regard to the application of karmayoga of the\r\nGita to social causes is that he developed the technique of Satyagraha based on Ahimsa. While Gandhiji was\r\nbusy experimenting with mans applications of Ahimsa to deal with issues of social injustice, discrimination and\r\nexploitation, just then Tilak completes his commentary on the Gita emphasizing karmayoga and lokasamgraha\r\nas the main teaching thereof.\r\nAccording to Gandhiji the practical application of karmayoga of the Gita means the Voluntary\r\nacceptance and enthusiastic fulfillment of duties that naturally comes one\u2019s way, i.e. Swadharma. The Gita\r\nfurther insists on cultivating an attitude of equanimity, a state of perfection is represented in the personality of a\r\nSthitaprajna. This is also meant Satyagrahi. So he thought that patriotism is for him a stage on his journey to the\r\nland of eternal freedom and peace.\r\nAnother concept of the Gita which helps Gandhi strengthen the social aspect of the teaching is yajna\r\nand he values the approach of the Gita of modifying the meaning of yajna. The Gita envisages the possibility of\r\nusing fire in a symbolic sense, but Gandhi tries to create public opinion in favour of subjecting every religious\r\npractice to the test of relevance in modern times (ibid pp.232-235 ).\r\nA Study on Karmayoga in Bhagavad Gita\r\n*Corresponding Author: Gobinda Bhattacharjee 18 | Page\r\nKARMAYOGIN BALGANGADHAR TILAK\r\nBalgangadhar Tilak, a great freedom fighter, social worker was born at Ratnagiri in 1856.

According to Tilak, the whole of India is dharmaksetra, the field of\r\nrighteousness of modern india (Tilak, B. (1935). Srimad Bhagavadgita Rahasya or Karmayoga Sastra, pp. 90-\r\n91).\r\nTilak recognizes that the Gita advocates at least three paths of conduct for the seeker of perfection and\r\none of them is niskama karma or disinterested work. The concept of niskama karma is based on the universality\r\nof action and no man is free from performing his dharma or work directed towards his own realese and the\r\nwelfare of the world. All human actions are motivated by the desire to attain happiness. Tilak distinguishes\r\nbetween desires of two types (a) desire for the fruit of our action and (b) desire which motivates us to perform\r\nright actions.\r\nAccording to Tilak, the concept of niskama karma may be specifically related to our castes, but that it\r\napplies nevertheless to all persons in all societies with or without caste. So the caste rules are not the final\r\nsource of duty in modern India. The duty which has fallen on one\u2019s shoulders may have been taken up by one as\r\na duty with own choice becomes a moral duty (Ibid. p. 697). So niskama karma provides the technique of\r\nperforming one\u2019s duty.\r\nTilak was one of the commentators who gave a new interpretation to the overall message of the Gita.\r\nTilak thought that the Lord tought the Gita not only to Arjuna but to all of us. Tilak extended the meaning of\r\nArjuna\u2019 so as to include everybody and he also explained the word \u2018kuruksetra\u2019, the place where the pandavas\r\nand kauravas was fought. The Gita speaks of kuruksetra as dharmaksetra or the sacred ground. Mnay\r\ncommentators before Tilak had tried to explain the same. But Tilak adopted a new approach and boldly stated\r\nthe whole of india is a \u2018dharmakestra\u2019 for modern India.\r\nAccording to Tilak, niskarma karma is the main teaching of the Gita which is based on the universality\r\nof action and where it was said that no man can alive free from performing activities of dharma directed\r\ntowards his own release and the welfare of the world. The Gita itself encouraged to arise the desire of Arjuna\r\nwhich sprang from his discontentment, but that was a desire to know the manifestation of the divine (ibid. p\r\n697).\r\nTilak interpreted this as the final culmination of all yogas as karma, jnana and bhakti. From the ethical\r\npoint of view, under any circumstances evil doers should be punished by the Lord in the interest of general welfare. God himself appears as avatara or incarnation to destroy evil doers and to protect virtuous people.", "start_char_idx": 36567, "end_char_idx": 39478, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"227de336-529a-429f-bc76-94a2df494f65": {"node_ids": ["0648aab9-db99-45f0-ae23-bcbcf09e0767", "96a5afed-4035-488c-9677-10c9ec52c23d", "89e41f55-41ce-4152-b248-11050885c9a3", "511d9c43-66a5-4205-9d6e-5cbb1fba2c45", "b1ed6057-efb4-4041-a476-2a127f4f7be3", "e10e22a4-bc2d-42a2-a68c-453370fc0105", "7c869952-c9c0-4d8e-a7d3-9eb8e67ed29c", "525f9a77-c9e5-41a7-b01b-66ffa307e554", "73e5f7f0-2de8-4927-b84e-9ec873601587", "97071ec4-c711-4a15-a50c-130b6d3e4264", "a69dab44-cf4a-4f8c-8c86-38aaee2622b0", "d82c5bf4-082d-45e4-9680-43e4651807da", "6238a3f8-6274-45b6-914d-c186c8125f9c"], "metadata": {"file_path": "E:\\Indepth-GENAI-main\\QA_Using_LlamaIndex_Gemini\\Data\\MLDOC.txt", "file_name": "MLDOC.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 39766, "creation_date": "2024-03-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-12"}}}}
